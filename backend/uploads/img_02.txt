~PA 7.5 #38... 

The balance on a 6-year loan is $6,838. 
If the simple interest rate is 5.25% per year, 
what was the principal borrowed? 

B: balance ~ 6838 
r: interest ~ 5.25 
P: principal ~ ? 
t: time ~ 6 

I = Prt 
= P(1+(5.25)(6)) 
= P(1+31.5) 
THIS IS THE INTEREST OVER 6 YEARS w/ 5.25% RATE. 

So... interest + principal = 6838 
6627.6 + 210.4 = 6838 

6838 = P(1+(5.25)(6)) 
= P(1+31.5) 
= P(32.5) 

6838 = 32.5P 
32.5 = 32.5 
210.4 = P 

The principal that was borrowed is $210.40.
